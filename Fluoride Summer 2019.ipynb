        "The Summer 2019 Fluoride team investigated issues related to the Automated and Gravity systems, with the goal of determining ideal conditions for removing fluoride. Initial qualitative tests prompted fabrication changes. The team increased the sedimentation tube angle from 60° to 70° to avoid accumulation of floc \"gel\" on the plate settler. Clay was then added to observe its effects on the floc blanket. Fluoride concentrations were measured with an ion electrode to determine removal efficiency and to continue developing the Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm model. The group will continue testing concentrations of clay and PACl to determine optimal fluoride removal conditions."

        "\n",
        "The majority of AguaClara plants are located in Central America, where the sources of surface water originate from rivers and mountain streams. AguaClara's mission of providing access to safe drinking water for all has motivated the AguaClara team to expand and develop new goals. By considering and analyzing the differences in drinking water collected from groundwater sources in other regions around the world, AguaClara can serve communities outside of Central America who are deprived of access to safe drinking water.\n",
        "\n",
        "At some locations where there is little to no fluoride in drinking water, fluoride is added in for the purpose of strengthening teeth and deteriorating natural deposits [(NYC DEP, 2016)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate16.pdf). However, there are detrimental consequences when there is an excess concentration of fluoride in the water being consumed by inhabitants in the area. For example, there has been moderate to high fluoride pollution in regions such as Algeria, Thailand, Ghana, India, and Iran, whose major source of drinking water comes from groundwater sources. The pollution of groundwater in these regions is due to the mobile dissolution of fluorite, apatite, and topaz from weathered rocks, increasing the levels of fluoride in the groundwater [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). The effects of consuming excess fluoride include dental, skeletal, developmental, neurological, endocrine, reproductive, and carcinogenic issues that affect the health of the communities in areas of high fluoride concentrations [(Bhattacharya and Samal, 2018)](http://www.isca.in/rjrs/archive/v7/i4/6.ISCA-RJRS-2018-028.pdf). Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) regulated the concentration limit for fluoride in drinking water to be 1.5 mg/L [(Water-related diseases, 2016)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/diseases/fluorosis/en/).\n",
        "\n",
        "In India, the Bureau of India Standards set an upper limit of fluoride concentrations in drinking water to be 1 mg/L [(Bureau of India Standards, 2012)](https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.10500.2012). However, more than 65 million Indians consume drinking water above the recommended limit of 1.5 mg/L and some locations in India contain up to 20 mg/L, which risks the health of many communities [(LeChevallier and Au, 2004)](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9241562552/en/).\n",
        "\n",
        "AguaClara aspires to achieve the recommended limit of 1 mg/L or lower by the Bureau of India Standards and to implement the gravity-powered system of fluoride removal into the communities with excess concentrations of fluoride. The Fluoride team will be testing the automated apparatus and the gravity-powered apparatus with PACl and  fluoride to optimize fluoride removal to achieve residual concentration of less than 1 mg/L. If the gravity-powered fluoride removal apparatus operates in the optimal conditions of removing fluoride to a concentration of 1 mg/L, feasibility analysis on site will be performed to test whether the system can be used in the communities in India, which will allow AguaClara to provide access to safe drinking water in India and other locations that obtain water from groundwater sources."

        "## Literature Review\n",
        "###Fluoride\n",
        "Found in large concentrations in groundwater sources around the world, fluoride can pose serious health concerns if ingested in large quantities. While fluoride concentrations of 1.0 mg/L to 1.5 mg/L in drinking water are generally considered healthy and can help improve dental health, levels above 1.5 mg/L can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis, to which children are especially susceptible ([Jagtap et al, 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr2002855)). Fluoride levels are generally found to be below 1.5 mg/L in seawater, rivers, and lakes, but can be much higher in groundwater sources, especially in areas where minerals containing fluoride are located in abundance ([Fawell et al, 2006](https://books.google.com/books?id=7xu1yf-OC8oC&lpg=PR5&ots=f1CYqkjcYO&dq=fluoride%20drinking%20water&lr&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=fluoride%20drinking%20water&f=false)). Thus, the presence of fluoride poses an especially significant risk in regions that obtain much of their drinking water from underground aquifers. In rural India, for example, approximately 80% of water used for drinking comes from groundwater sources ([Jagtap et al, 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr2002855)). \n",
        "\n",
        "The World Health Organization has set a limit on fluoride in drinking water at 1.5 mg/L based on evidence that adverse health effects become prevalent at values above this standard. Furthermore, the WHO notes that in regions with elevated levels of fluoride intake via drinking water, \"fluoride is a significant cause of morbidity.\" ([WHO, 2004](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42852)). For this reason, the team is aiming for a reduction of fluoride in effluent water that adheres to this standard of 1.5 mg/L.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) and Defluoridation\n",
        "One common method of defluoridation for drinking water is a system that implements coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation. Coagulation is a process that involves adding a positively charged chemical coagulant to the raw water to be treated. Once the coagulant is well-mixed, it begins to destabilize colloidal and dissolved particles in the raw water ([EPA, 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). In the case of fluoride, polyaluminum chloride (PACl) is added to raw water and mixed well. PACl is used as the coagulant due to its reputation for being a superior coagulant for fluoride removal compared to other common aluminum salts. In addition, PACl has other logistic advantages such as being less reliant on raw water pH, a reduced level of alkalinity neutralization, and less waste production - all of which can be beneficial when considering implementing a treatment technology in a developing region ([He et al, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138358661630017X)). Dissolved fluoride ions are then targeted by this PACl and enter the flocculation stage of treatment. In flocculation, the destabilized particles from coagulation are encouraged to agglomerate together to form \"flocs\". There are several ways to instigate the agglomeration of these particles, with some common methods being a gentle mix, or a baffled plug-flow reactor ([EPA, 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). The goal during the period of flocculation is to maximize the probability of particle interaction between destabilized matter so that these species of interest will begin to form large flocs in the reactor. In other words, \"Aggregation requires successful collisions. Success is defined by particles attaching when they collide\" ([Weber-Shirk et al, 2018](aguaclara.github.io/Textbook/index.html)). These successful collisions are what allow for the removal of fluoride in the sedimentation process, where the agglomerated particles are separated from the water using gravity settling or other clarification methods ([EPA 2007](https://oaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=1934681921)). \n",
        "\n",
        "###The Floc Blanket\n",
        "\n",
        "Floc blankets are formed in tanks where water is fed downwards into a hopper-shaped geometry and allowed to redirect upwards. This flow redirection resuspends any particles that have settled to the bottom of the tank so that they may begin to agglomerate into a fluidized layer of floc in the tank ([Garland et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2015.0314). This collection of flocs, or blanket, typically rises to a point that is controlled by some type of weir or other means of particle separation from the treated water ([Gregory 1977](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/22645/2/Gregory-R-1977-MPhil-Thesis.pdf)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The benefit of using a floc blanket for particle removal is that as water travels upwards through the blanket, there is an increased chance that particles still in said water will be captured via collision in the blanket. The general idea is that the thicker the floc blanket, the more opportunities a floc particles will have to get caught on a larger particles somewhere in the blanket. While this is great for particles removal efficiency, it should be noted that not there will still be particles that are able to pass through the blanket. This is because the shear forces acting on some medium sized particles are often to great to allow them to remain attached to the larger flocs that have accumulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stability and quality of the floc blanket is a function of both the settling velocity of flocs and the upflow velocity through the sedimentation tank ([Su et al, 2004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135403005025)). For this reason, it is important that these two aspects are controlled carefully. Studies have shown that when one of these parameters experiences fluctuations, floc blankets can fail to function as intended which could lead to poor effluent water quality ([Su et al, 2004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135403005025)). In one case, a clarifier in Taiwan lost its entire floc blanket during a period of low turbidity measurements in the influent raw water ([Lin et al, 2004](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9372%282004%29130%3A12%281481%29)). Furthermore, conditions must be maintained that allow for the resuspension of agglomerated flocs into the fluidized bed, but not to a superfluous degree where flocs would be torn apart by high shear forces ([Garland et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2015.0314)).\n",
        "\n",
        "###Clay\n",
        "\n",
        "Clay was introduced into the fluoride system to investigate its usefulness as an indicator for flocculation. When fluoride flocs form with PACl, the resulting solids are clear and can only be seen when closely examining the sedimentation tube with a flashlight. It was hypothesized that by introducing clay after the flocculator, there may be some interaction between the fluoride flocs and the clay where the flocs would stick to clay particles and thereby become more visible. Furthermore, it was thought that there may be some added benefit by introducing clay, because clay particles that form by reaction with PACl tend to be much larger ([needs citation]()). Research has shown that clay can also play a part - especially in groundwater applications - in the adsorption of fluoride and other pollutants of interest ([Savenko 1999](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010496606751.pdf)). When paired with certain aluminum coagulation processes, Savenko says, the introduction of clay has been able to absorb up to 3.3 mg fluoride/g ([1999](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1010496606751.pdf)).\n",
        "\n",
        "###Langmuir Isotherm\n",
        "\n",
        "Langmuir isotherms are models that are used for the adsorption process, where some chemical species of interest is attracted to the surface of a solid where the two are then joined by either a physical or chemical bond ([Foo and Hameed, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2009.09.013)). These models allow for the delineation of relationships between the pollutant of interest and the adsorbent being used, and are thus very useful in giving a visual representation of adsorption effiency based on specific experimental conditions ([Foo and Hameed, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2009.09.013)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Past fluoride teams have used an isotherm to model the relationship between the amount of fluoride absorbed (mg) per gram of PACl introduced to the system and the effluent concentration of fluoride (mg/L). In this instance, fluoride is the pollutant of interest, and PACl can be considered the adsorbent material. The most recent version of this isotherm model can be seen below in Figure 1.\n",

        "The AguaClara Fluoride Automated System began in Fall 2016 after receiving an EPA Phase II grant in Spring 2016 [(Cheng et. al., 2016)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzej1vulT_XyWHZyLXdIWlk1RkE/view). The team focused on using PACl for particle removal using only a floc blanket. The team ran tests with red dye in place of fluoride so that turbidity and visual observation could be used to gauge particle removal. The team determined that the floc blanket must be at some minimum height greater than 5 cm for effective removal of red dye. In addition, a sloped bottom geometry for the base of the sedimentation tube was fabricated to prevent the settling of flocs at the bottom of the reactor and subsequent clogging. The main goal of this new bottom geometry was to remove any flat horizontal surfaces so that flocs that reached the bottom would have to recirculate instead of settling. \n",
        "\n",
        "The 2017 teams used clay in the system, but stopped using clay after observing high levels of turbidity in the effluent. Using high levels of PACl (25 mg/L), the team was able to produce an effluent with a concentration of as low as 0.05 mg/L [(Longo et. al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202017/Fluoride%20Spring%202017.pdf). Additionally, initial tests were conducted with both single and multi-reactor systems, but the single reactor system was ultimately chosen after taking large-scale cost and labor into consideration [(Longo et. al., 2017)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fall%202017/fluoride-fall-2017.pdf).\n",

        "The Spring 2018 team varied ran experiments in which they either changed the influent PACl concentration or the influent fluoride concentration, in order to collect data for the developing Langmuir Isotherm, an adsorption model that was thought to describe the interaction between polyaluminum chloride and particles in the water such as red dye or fluoride ions [(Akpan et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202018/FluorideReportSp18.md). Skepticism over the accuracy of the probe led to somewhat inconclusive data.\n",

        "In Summer 2018, the team concentrated on continuing to run experiments to gain more data to plot against the Langmuir Isotherm [(Pang et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Summer%202018/Fluoride_Summer2018.md). The team plotted uptake, or the mass of fluoride removed per the mass of influent PACl, against the effluent fluoride concentration and concluded that the PACl was effective in removing fluoride from the influent water, even if an optimal dosage of PACl had not yet been determined.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fall 2018 team experienced the significant obstacle of gel buildup in the reactor [(Mehrabyan et. al., 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Fall%202018/Automated%20System/Fall_2018_Report.md). Functioning floc blankets should be a fluidized bed of particles that are constantly recirculating, while gel is a mass of flocs that tend to adhere to the side of the reactor and do not recirculate. The reoccurrence of gel in most of the experiments caused early failure due to blockage of the floc weir entrance and the ensuing escape of flocs through the effluent tubing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spring 2019 team continued the task of testing different ratios of PACl to fluoride and plotting the data of previous semesters against the Langmuir Isotherm [(Sausele et. al., 2019)](https://github.com/AguaClara/Fluoride-Auto/blob/master/Spring%202019/Fluoride-Auto-Spring-2019-Report.md). The data from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019 is shown in the Results and Analysis section. The Spring 2019 team also transitioned from using MathCad for determining experimental flow rates to using Python, which is currently being used for experimental calculations as well as graphing and data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the Spring 2019 team ran tests to see if the fluoride probe could detect fluoride in the form of flocs or not. High-turbidity samples of effluent that contained flocs were measured with the fluoride probe. After filtering the samples through mesh, their concentrations were measured once more. The team found significant percent increases in measured fluoride concentration after filtering, which led to the conclusion that the mesh helped break up the flocs into a form that the probe was able to detect."

        "In the previous experiments run by the Fluoride Automated System, the waste line valve was kept open and the waste line pump was kept running. However, the Summer 2019 team closed the waste line valve for both the Fluoride Automated and Gravity systems' experiments to further optimize the system by allowing for accumulation of flocs to form in the floc weir and be emptied out at once when the weir is full. Also, the flocs are expected to fall into the floc weir even if the waste line valve is closed due to the angle of the plate settler and the displacement of water in the floc weir and the heavier flocs. Therefore, throughout all of the Fluoride Summer 2019 team's experiments, the waste line valve is remained closed. Since the Automated System's and the Gravity System's sedimentation tubes are designed differently based on the placement of the floc weirs as seen in Figure 5 and Figure 6, the Summer 2019 team tested both sedimentation tubes on the Automated System with the same dosages of red dye and PACl to observe which sedimentation tube's floc weir allowed for the accumulation of flocs with the waste pump off and the waste valve closed.\n",

        " * **Addition of the Flow Accumulator in the Automated System:** Early on in the summer, the team observed pulsing in the influent water tube, which continued in the flocculator and sedimentation tube. Thus, the team implemented the Flow Accumulator, which is a bottle with both an influent and effluent opening. The bottle is filled with water just enough to cover these openings, then capped tightly in order to allow the air pressure inside the bottle to facilitate the flow of water out of the bottle, free of pulsations from the pump.\n",
        " * **Increased Angle of the Sedimentation Tube:** In previous semesters, the team used a sedimentation tube with a bend that was 60° from the horizontal. In the initial tests that the Summer 2019 team ran, flocs seemed to be accumulating above the floc weir, on the plate settlers. The team then increased the angle of the bend to 70° in an attempt to allow flocs to slide down the plate settlers more easily and thus prevent the build up of flocs above the floc weir.\n",
        " * **Uniform Reactor for Automated and Gravity System:** In the Spring 2019 semester, the Automated and Gravity systems used sedimentation tubes that were uniform in angle (the bend was 60° from the horizontal) and lengths. However, the systems differed in their placement of the floc weir. While the Gravity system floc weir was above the bend of the tube, like the one shown above in Figure 9, the Automated system floc weir was on the vertical part of the sedimentation tube, as shown below. The Automated team also connected a 1 RPM waste pump to the floc weir to remove flocs. The Summer 2019 decided to use two sedimentation tubes with the same specifications in order to be able to compare experiments done on both systems. Thus, the team fabricated two sedimentation tubes with a bend that was 70° from the horizontal and a floc weir above the bend instead of on the vertical part of the sedimentation tube. The team also decided to not include the waste pump in the system, as gravity proved to be sufficient for flocs to exit the weir. Finally, the Spring 2019 Automated and Gravity teams used different bottom geometries, but after initial testing, a working bottom geometry was determined and implemented in both systems.

        "Effluent water from a fluoride experiment may contain fluoride ions that were unable to flocculate, but also fluoride in the form of flocs, which are complexes of aluminum-hydroxyl and fluoride. Ion selective electrodes are designed to measure the concentration of ions in solution; thus, flocs cannot always be detected by the probe. The Spring 2019 team had collected data that showed an increase in the fluoride concentration reading after filtering through mesh, so the Summer 2019 repeated the same type of tests by taking samples of fluoride from the flocculator and measuring their concentrations before and after filtering. However, these new tests proved to be inconclusive, as many of the samples showed an insignificant increase in the concentration reading following filtration. The team is still unsure of why the results are so different from those in Spring 2019; one possible reason is that the probe used in Spring 2019 was nearly at the end of its life cycle and may not have been as accurate as it could have been, whereas the Summer 2019 team purchased a new probe at the beginning of June.\n",

Since pH is an integral aspect of flocculation that had not been previously discussed in depth in other semesters of research on fluoride removal, the Summer 2019 sought more information on it. The comprehensive manual provided by the probe manufacturer suggested using Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer (TISAB) I or III as a way to create the correct pH in the solution at which fluoro-aluminum complexes would be able to break apart.\n",

        "For the majority of the summer experiments that were run so far, the floc blanket built up past the floc weir and sometimes gelled on the plate settlers before the floc weir was completely filled. The team defined this state of the system as failure, because the floc weir was not adequately removing flocs from the sedimentation tube.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, gelling was a phenomenon that has occurred sporadically in both red dye and fluoride experiments in previous and current semesters. An essential characteristic of a properly working floc blanket is continuous recirculation of flocs. Gels form when a large accumulation of flocs builds up so much that the flocs within it are unable to recirculate or move, and other separate flocs must take a path around it rather than through it. The Summer 2019 team, like the Fall 2018 team, defined any buildup of gel, whether in the bottom of the reactor or on the plate settlers, to signal failure in the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of defining how a system fails is key to this research. Previous semesters had removed ionic fluoride, which was evident through the high uptake values from the data. However, the nature of the experiments were very different from those run by the Summer 2019 team. The previous experiments would occur for several hours and sometimes overnight, while in contrast the Summer 2019 experiments are run and monitored closely over a period of one to two hours. Previous teams did not focus on checking if flocs were actually exiting through the floc weir either. Thus, it is possible that previous semesters were not removing flocs and were instead sending flocs through the effluent that were not detectable by the fluoride probe."

        "### Introducing Clay into the System\n",
        "A few weeks into the summer semester, the team began to think of a different approach of removing fluoride. As aforementioned, fluoride in both its ionic and floc form is nearly invisible and in the lab requires a flashlight held against the sedimentation tube in order to view the floc blanket. Existing AguaClara plants currently use turbidity as an indicator of particle removal, however, the fluoride flocs would present a challenge to plant operators because of their lack of turbidity. \n",
        "\n",
        "The team decided to try adding clay into the system, with the goal of increasing the visibility of the fluoride flocs to both the turbidimeter and to the naked eye. Additionally, since clay particles are more massive than fluoride particles, the team hypothesized that the addition of clay would increase the mass of the flocs and thus allow the flocs to fall into the floc weir more easily rather than continuing to build up past the floc weir as they had been in experiments conducted before the addition of clay. The clay pump was added after the flocculator, so that the fluoride would have sufficient time to bind with the PACl in the flocculator and not have to compete with the clay particles. Because of the placement of the pump, the team set a timer for 5 minutes after starting each experiment before turning on the clay pump, to give the fluoride and PACl time to make it through the flocculator before adding clay. This time was an approximation because the team was unable to see fluoride in the flocculator.\n",
        "\n",
        "The addition of clay to the fluoride system was not a completely new change to the AguaClara fluoride removal research. The Spring 2016 team added clay to their system but decided that it was not a necessary component because it caused the effluent turbidity to rise and did not aid in the removal of fluoride, by their standards. However, research has changed drastically since Spring 2016 that have made clay an appealing re-addition to the system. The main factor was a new focus on collecting more accurate readings of effluent fluoride concentrations. The effluent water may contain fluoride ions that remained unflocculated throughout the flocculator and sedimentation tube, which are detectable by the fluoride probe. However, it may also contain flocs that were not captured by the floc weir or floc blanket, which are complexes of aluminum hydroxyl and fluoride that are not always detectable using an ion selective electrode. \n",
        "\n",
        "The previous section details the attempts to understand the fluoride probe and ensure that the effluent fluoride is in a form that the probe can sense. However, the point of adding the clay was to try a different way of gauging success, by tracking turbidity rather than effluent fluoride concentration. The team observed an increase in turbidity while cleaning out the system and sending a large number of flocs through the effluent, but a significant increase in turbidity was not seen during regular experiments even when flocs were seen exiting through the effluent. At this point in the semester, the team is still unsure of the effect that the flocs have on turbidity. In comparison, the previous fluoride teams observed a much more definite and concrete increase in effluent turbidity when adding clay to the system. Thus, the Summer 2019 hypothesis was that the clay would bind to the fluoro-aluminum complexes and make the nearly clear flocs more turbid, which could then be used as an indicator for failure or success. An increase in turbidity could mean that fluoride was also escaping and would thus signal failure."

One of the goals from the Spring 2019 Automated team was to figure out if there was possibly an optimal upflow velocity between 1 mm/s and 1.5 mm/s that was low enough to ensure that the floc blanket could form properly but high enough to prevent gel from building up in the sedimentation tube. \n",

However, after observing the flocs gelling on the plate settlers in many of the experiments, the team decided to try a higher upflow velocity to see if it would change the outcome of the experiment. After adding clay, the team ran qualitative experiments to see how the floc blanket would behave  if the upflow velocity was higher than 1 mm/s. The team ran several tests at 1.5 mm/s and one experiment at 1.2 mm/s, both with 5 mg/L of fluoride, 10 mg/L of PACl, and 4 mg/L of clay."

The fluoride sedimentation tubes since Fall 2016 all used 1\" inner diameter PVC for the sedimentation tube and plate settler and 3/4\" inner diameter PVC for the floc weir. However, the choice to use a thinner tube for the floc weir was originally an arbitrary fabrication decision, so the current fluoride team decided to see how a larger weir would affect the removal of flocs.\n",

The flocs on the plate settler became a gel at the bend since the flocs did not fall and recirculate. When the team turned on the waste pump and opened the waste valve, the flocs started entering the floc weir.

It is hypothesized that this occurred because fluoride flocs tend to be more \"sticky\" by nature, and thus when accummulating on the settler, they would collect instead of sliding down into the floc blanket. This issue was averted when increasing the angle of the plate settler to 70° because the slope was steep enough where instead of collecting, the flocs would be forced to slide down into the floc blanket. Moreover, flocs were observed sliding down the settler at 70° for both the auto fluoride system and the gravity fluoride system."

The team observed that, at a fluoride concentration of 5 mg/L, a PACl concentration of 10 mg/L, and an upflow velocity of 1.5 mm/s, the flocs seemed to build up a gel at the entrance of the floc weir. The gel was made up of flocs that appeared to be unmoving at the opening of the weir; other flocs from the floc blanket were able to move around the side of the gel but not through it. Compared to behavior of flocs in the weir on the normal sedimentation tubes, the flocs fell much slower and seemed to stop a few inches below the entrance instead of falling all the way to the end.

        "So far, the Summer 2019 team has tested different PACl concentrations on 5 mg/L of influent fluoride in both the Automated and Gravity systems. Despite a few successful experiments in both systems, the majority of tests resulted in the buildup of flocs and gel on the plate settlers before the floc weir was filled to capacity, which the team deemed to be failed experiments. The team added clay to the Automated system and has thus far concluded that, while the measured uptake of the system with clay has not been significantly higher than the uptake without clay, the weir seems to be more successful at capturing flocs when clay is present. An upflow velocity of 1 mm/s was determined to be usable for experiments, since it allowed a proper floc blanket to form but did not allow gel to form at the bottom of the reactor. \n",

        "Going forward, the team plans to continue systematically testing different PACl-to-fluoride ratios in order to obtain an optimal coagulant dosage that will lead to an effluent concentration below 1.0 mg/L of fluoride. The influent fluoride concentrations to be tested will be between 1 and 10 mg/L, in order to simulate realistic groundwater conditions ([Rao et.al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00254-003-0873-3))\n",
        "\n",
        "As clay was just recently introduced into the automated system and the team has not confirmed its role in the sedimentation process, clay will continue to be added and observed to determine how it affects fluoride removal and at what dosage it should be added if it is deemed necessary to the process. In the current setup, clay is added after the flocculator and before the sedimentation tube. However, the team will also test the system with clay added before the flocculator, to see if the process will improve or not. Once there is enough evidence to inform the team's decision about where the clay should enter the system and at which dosage, clay will be implemented into the gravity-powered system and tested. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to running more experiments with clay, the team is in the process of developing a method of analyzing the effects of both PACl and clay dosages at the same time. One consideration is to plot uptake against an influent concentration of clay. When more data points are obtained, the team will try plotting this graph and see if it yields any insight.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of potentially making geometrical changes to the system, the team is considering increasing the angle of the 1\" floc weir and seeing if the flocs can be removed without clay. If the larger floc weir proves to be successful, clay may no longer be necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the testing in the next several weeks, the results of each experiment will continue to be plotted on the Uptake vs. Effluent Concentration graph, with the ultimate goal of creating a model or best fit line that will provide insight as to how AguaClara plants should treat water with a high fluoride content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the team will continue trying different methods of decomplexing the aluminum hydroxyl fluoride complexes that make up flocs. The goal is to ensure that all of the fluoride in the effluent is in the form of ions rather than flocs so that all the fluoride can be detected by the ion selective probe. Once there is a reliable way to consistently decomplex flocs, the team will use a uniform measuring process for experiments going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the future, experiments will also be more closely monitored in terms of time to failure. The Summer 2019 team has so far observed failure times within two, and occasionally one, hour. One of the major goals going forward will be not only to remove a significant amount of fluoride from influent water but also to ensure that the system will work for many hours instead of failing so quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of making this process more accessible to a plant operator, the team will continue to explore and discuss ways in which successful treatment of the water can be visibly confirmed, since the fluoride ions as well as flocs are currently clear and difficult to see without a flashlight. The team hypothesizes that adding the clay to the treatment process may increase the turbidity of the flocs and thus give plant operators a concrete way of determining that the effluent water is safe to drink. This hypothesis will be tested within the next few weeks as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the progress that the AguaClara Fluoride team has made over the past three years, there still remain many unknown aspects of fluoride treatment that must be addressed before the process can be used in the field."
